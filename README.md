# Chat-Application
A simple Real-Time Chat Application built using Python (Socket Programming).
This project allows multiple users to connect and chat with each other in real time through a client-server model.

Features :-

Real-time messaging between multiple clients

Server-client architecture using Python sockets

Each user gets a unique name on joining

Secure and efficient message broadcasting

Server automatically handles client connections/disconnections

 How It Works :-

The Server listens for new client connections.

Each Client connects to the server using IP and Port.

Messages from one client are broadcasted to all others.

The chat continues until a client leaves or the server stops.
